              <p>My name is Adam and I am a Web Developer.  When I am not hammering away on my keyboard, I enjoy traveling, baseball and gaming. I moved to Austin in 2017 and am enjoying all this city has to offer.</p>
              <p>You can catch me trying to watch every single Chicago Cubs game, and I try to see a live game at least once a year, sometimes it doesn't always work out. I am married to a German, she doesn't care for baseball, so mostly I watch all...by...myself...</p>
